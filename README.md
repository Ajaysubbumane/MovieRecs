This phased approach allows us to focus on one major piece of functionality at a time. We'll get a working product in Phase 1, and then make it powerful and personalized in the subsequent phases.

What do you think of this more detailed plan? Does it capture your vision for the project? If you're happy with this, we can officially begin with **Phase 1, Step 1: Backend Setup**.
